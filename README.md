# Title of the Project
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro developmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, and often, unique strengths and differences. It isn't a "behavioral disease" in the traditional sense but rather a neurological condition affecting how individuals perceive and socialize with the world around them. ASD isn't something that can be "cured," but interventions and support can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD, aiding in managing symptoms and fostering better social integration
# About
In the contemporary realm of cyber security, the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) emerges as a critical component in fortifying network infrastructures against potential threats. Functioning as a vigilant sentry, NIDS continually monitors network traffic in real-time to identify and counteract malicious activities, encompassing unauthorized access and suspicious patterns. In existing NIDS are characterized by two primary paradigms. The first is signature-based detection, a conventional approach reliant on a database housing predefined patterns or signatures associated with known threats. While effective against established risks, this method falters in the face of evolving threats, such as zero-day attacks, where vulnerabilities are exploited before updates can be implemented. The paradigm, anomaly-based detection, focuses on identifying deviations from established baselines. Though adept at recognizing unknown threats, anomaly detection tends to produce false positives due to the challenge of distinguishing between legitimate variations in network behavior and actual security breaches [3]. The hybrid approach seeks to marry both signature and anomaly detection methods to provide a more comprehensive defense mechanism. However, finding the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity remains a challenge, and continuous updates are imperative to adapt to the dynamic threat landscape. Notwithstanding their utility, these methodologies are not without drawbacks. Signature-based systems are constrained by their reliance on historical data and predefined patterns, making them susceptible to rapidly evolving threats. Anomaly-based detection, while versatile, places a considerable strain on resources and often generates false positives.
# Features
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its security, portability, and robustness. Originally called "Oak" and developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the 1990s, Java has evolved into a versatile technology adopted across industries and platforms. The Java platform provides a runtime environment and APIs that allow Java code to run on any device, from desktops to mobile phones to embedded systems. Key Java technologies like Servlets, JSP, and frameworks like Spring and Hibernate enable scalable enterprise and web applications. With a rich feature set and vibrant ecosystem, Java supports a diverse range of applications - from standalone desktop software to server-side web systems, games, and robotics. Java's history and continued innovation ensure its position as a dominant, flexible programming language fitting many roles across the modern technology landscape.

There are 4 platforms or editions of Java:

1) Java SE (Java Standard Edition): It is a Java programming platform. It includes Java programming APIs such as java.lang, java.io, java.net, java.util, java.sql, java.math etc. It includes core topics like OOPs, String, Regex, Exception, Inner classes, Multithreading, I/O Stream, Networking, AWT, Swing, Reflection, Collection, etc.

2) Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition): It is an enterprise platform that is mainly used to develop web and enterprise applications. It is built on top of the Java SE platform. It includes topics like Servlet, JSP, Web Services, EJB, JPA, etc.

3) Java ME (Java Micro Edition): It is a micro platform that is dedicated to mobile applications.

4) JavaFX: It is used to develop rich internet applications. It uses a lightweight user interface API.
